Hello fellow students,

My name is Edward Cruz, Jr., and I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you. I am proud to be Native American and hold a BBA in Accounting from Incarnate Word College '88', now known as the University of the Incarnate Word. Additionally, I have earned two master’s degrees: an MBA from Texas A&M University-San Antonio '21' and an MSBA from Texas A&M University-Commerce '22'.

My journey in life has been enriched by my 24 years of service in the United States Marine Corps, where I retired with the rank of Master Sergeant (MSgt) and an Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) veteran. After my military career, I transitioned into the supplier diversity market, where I have over seventeen years of experience. During this time, I found great satisfaction in assisting small and diverse businesses in securing contracting opportunities. It was in this role that I discovered my passion for data analysis, as I frequently presented visual outcomes to public board members and stakeholders. This newfound interest has led me here, where I am eager to further enhance my data analysis skills.

On a personal note, I have been blessed with a supportive and patient wife, and we have been happily married for over 30 years. We have two wonderful daughters: our eldest recently graduated from Texas A&M University-San Antonio, and our youngest is a second-year student at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

In my free time, I enjoy a variety of hobbies. I am passionate about cooking, farming, and beekeeping—raising and recovering bees and simply watching their lively activities at my hives brings me immense joy. I also love being outdoors, fly fishing, and staying active as a dedicated gym enthusiast.
